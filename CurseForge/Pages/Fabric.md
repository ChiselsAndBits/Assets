<p>
  This version of the mod is developed specifically for Minecraft Fabric.
  As such it requires Fabric to function properly, in particular the <a href="https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/">Fabric Loader</a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api">Fabric API</a>.
</p>
<div>
  If you want to play with Chisels & Bits on Minecraft Forge then you will need a different version of the mod. One that is specifically designed to work with Forge, its loader and its API.
  This particular version of the mod can be found: <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chisels-bits">here</a>.

</p>
<p>
  Chisels and Bits is a Minecraft Mod which allows you to cut udiv the large blocks that make udiv your world, and place the little cuts back down.
  In any way you like.
</p>

<div>
  <div>You want smoother stairs? Go for it.</div>
  <div>You want better looking roofs? Or Pillars? It is all possible now.</div>
</div>
<p/>
<div>
  You can make entirely new looking and feeling blocks by mixing and matching the bits of different already existing blocks.
</div>

</p>
<p>
  By default, all solid, simple, full cube blocks, like logs, planks, ores, storage blocks (diamond, emerald, iron etc) are supported.
  Additionally, some specific blocks are curated by hand, this is especially done for all glass blocks, leaves and grass blocks.  
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>
  The scan for compatible blocks automatically also detects all mod blocks which are compatible.
  If a mod maker wants to control the selection procedure for his or her blocks, he can do so, by adding them to either one of two tags:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>chiselsandbits:chiselable/forced</code>
    to force the block to be chiselable (handy for glass like blocks)
  </li>
  <li>
    <code> chiselsandbits:chiselable/blocked</code>
    to prevent a block that is normally chiselable to be chiseled.
  </li>
</ul>
